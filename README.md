W10A01 - Bakery Revisited (jQuery Plugin and UI Widgets)
For this assignment, you will get an opportunity to add jQuery UI widgets, a jQuery UI theme, and a jQuery Plugin to an existing application. None of the existing base functionality will be changed from the starting application. It will just be enhanced an a Cake Gallery will be added. Starting HTML, CSS and Javascript files, and supporting folder structures have been provided. All may need to be updated depending on what you choose to do. The goal of this assignment is to complete it

Project Overview
When the Bakery application is rendered, it should resemble the following screen shot:

Your completed solution may look similar to the following screen shots (depending on what jQuery UI Theme you chose and which jQuery Plugin you elected to use for the Cake Gallery, there could be some differences in look and feel).

See video for the animation that I chose to finish the assignment with. If you want to do the same type of animation, you are certainly free to do that. You are also free to experiment and try out other options if you care to go that way on this assignment.

Various jQuery Dialogs displayed when attempting to place order with no items in cart and then when it gets to the point where validation is passed, but we are not implementing the checkout option.

For this assignment, you must:

Select a jQuery UI Theme (either select an existing or create a custom theme), and select widgets to download. Place relevant images in the images directory and the minified javascript and css files in the correct locations within the file solution and also in the index.html file. Watch jQuery Accordion video for guidance.

Add a jQuery UI Tab and place all the contents of the page in the first tab. The second tab will be populated when the Cake Gallery content is added. Verify that the Tab is working before proceeding to next step. Watch jQuery Tab video for guidance.

Replace the buttons with jQuery UI buttons. You may add just the regular buttons. Four points extra credit will be awarded if you add jQuery UI buttons with icons to the right of the text (you will need to use the online documentation on the jQuery UI site in order to accomplish this). Watch jQuery Button & Dialog video for guidance on adding a standard button.

Add two dialogs to the page which should be used to replace the alert statements in the starting JavaScript code. Watch jQuery Button & Dialog video for guidance on adding a dialog.

Implement a Cake Gallery. Small (150x150) images and large (400x400) images have been included in the images section. Implement some type of picture gallery function utilizing a jQuery Plugin. In this solution, I have implemented the Lightbox plugin. You may use Lightbox as well. However, four extra credit points are available if you choose and successfully implement a Gallery or Carousel that was not covered in the textbook or video. Whichever plugin is implemented, the applicable css and js minified files need to be added to the project solution. Watch jQuery Lightbox video for guidance on implementing the Lightbox Plugin.

Test your solution to ensure that all functionality that was initially provided in the application still works with the new jQuery UI widgets as well as your implemented Cake Gallery Plugin code.
